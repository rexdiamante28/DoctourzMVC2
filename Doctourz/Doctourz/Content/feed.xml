        <![CDATA[<p>Commencement speakers love to give flowery advice: Dare to dream! Reach for the stars! Embrace the whole new world waiting for you on the other side of graduation!&nbsp;</p>

<p>They&rsquo;re a <em>little</em> less likely to mention what really matters when it comes to securing your long-term success. A lot of it involves adjusting to adult life and learning what it means to be healthy, both physically and mentally&mdash;and&nbsp;that&#39;s a struggle for many new grads.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>A</span><span>fter you change out of your cap and gown, keep this cheat sheet on health&nbsp;</span><span>mistakes to avoid in mind. You&#39;ll be <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/adulting?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Ehashtag">#adulting</a> like a pro in no time.&nbsp;</span></p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #1: Going to urgent care for all your medical needs</strong></h3>

<p>We get it: you&#39;re young, you&#39;re healthy, and you haven&#39;t been sick since that unfortunate case of mono in the 11th grade. But building a relationship with a primary care doctor now establishes your baseline level of health and allows for continuity of care. And, in parts of the country where there are <a href="http://www.jhsph.edu/research/centers-and-institutes/johns-hopkins-primary-care-policy-center/Publications_PDFs/2007_IJHS_Macinko.pdf">more primary care physicians</a>, people live longer and have lower rates of cancer, heart disease, stroke, and other medical conditions, according to study published in the&nbsp;<em>International Journal of Health Services</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If none of that&#39;s enough to sway you, then remember: on many insurance plans, a trip to the emergency room or urgent&nbsp;care is more expensive than a visit to a PCP.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://news.health.com/2016/02/09/the-early-signs-of-stroke-you-need-to-know-even-if-youre-young/">The Early Signs of Stroke You Need to Know&mdash;Even if You&#39;re Young</a></p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #2: Skipping health insurance</strong></h3>

<p>Speaking of insurance, you really won&#39;t be saving any money if you don&#39;t sign up for it after you graduate. The Affordable Care Act says you&nbsp;<i>have&nbsp;</i>to&nbsp;be insured,&nbsp;and you can get <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/fees/fee-for-not-being-covered/">hit with a fine</a> if you don&rsquo;t register quickly enough. You can usually be added to a parent&rsquo;s health plan if it covers dependents and you&rsquo;re under 26&mdash;even if you&#39;re living on your own. If you&rsquo;re younger than 30, you can buy <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/choose-a-plan/plans-categories/#catastrophic">a catastrophic plan with low monthly premiums</a>; you&rsquo;ll pay most non-emergency medical expenses yourself, but coverage includes three&nbsp;primary care visits each year&mdash;as well as preventive care like shots and screenings&mdash;before you hit your deductible.</p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #3: Eating a sad desk lunch every day&nbsp;</strong></h3>

<p>Chowing down in front of the computer might seem like a good way to gain traction at a new job. In fact, one 2012 survey found that <a href="http://www.right.com/wps/wcm/connect/right-us-en/home/thoughtwire/categories/media-center/Just+OneinFive+Employees+Take+Actual+Lunch+Break">39% of employees spend their lunch breaks at their desks</a>. Truth is, in the working world, many of us aren&rsquo;t counterbalancing our hours of inactivity with regular movement (such as crisscrossing campus for classes). Moreover, &ldquo;when we eat distracted, we tend not to enjoy, appreciate, or even register the calories&mdash;they&rsquo;re calories eaten, calories forgotten,&rdquo; says Katherine Zeratsky, RD, an associate professor of nutrition at the Mayo Clinic. &ldquo;If you absolutely <em>have </em>to eat at your desk, appreciate each bite of food in your mouth, chew it, notice that you&rsquo;re chewing it&mdash;and do so at least several times before you swallow it&mdash;and <em>then </em>type a paragraph or read what you have to read. If you can take a bit of time to appreciate your food, you&rsquo;re less likely to be looking for a snack an hour or two later because you forgot you ate.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #4: Getting out of the exercise habit</strong></h3>

<p>Regular exercise at a campus gym? No sweat. Juggling physical fitness with an entirely new set of life circumstances? Not so straightforward. Researchers have found<span> that even elite college athletes <a href="http://sph.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/05/09/1941738114534813">struggle to exercise consistently</a> after graduation, and that </span><em>everyone </em><span>who wants to squeeze into their favorite big-game tee a few years later stands a better chance of doing so if they <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20907868,00.html">make exercise a habit</a> ASAP.&nbsp;First step: Find an activity you really love, whether it&#39;s SoulCycle, <a href="http://news.health.com/2016/01/13/orangetheory-fitness-trend-2015-facts/">Orangetheory</a>, CrossFit, dance classes, or something else. </span>Those people you know who get up at 6 a.m. to run do it because they truly enjoy it (we hope).&nbsp;</p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #5: Ignoring stress </strong></h3>

<p>A study in <em>Social Science &amp; Medicine </em>linked <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953614007503">student loan debt to poor mental health</a> for young men and women. Generation Opportunity, a nonpartisan youth advocacy group, reported that the national unemployment rate for people between ages 18 and 29&nbsp;is <a href="http://generationopportunity.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/State_of_the_Millennial_2016.pdf">more than double</a> that of Americans older than 29. Finding one&rsquo;s way in the working world has never been easy, but some argue that it&rsquo;s never been harder than it is right now&mdash;and millennials report <a href="http://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/stress/2014/stress-report.pdf">higher levels of stress</a> than any other generation. &ldquo;Stress can impact everything from one&rsquo;s sleep to their energy, attention, concentration, and interpersonal relationships,&rdquo; says Simon Rego, PsyD, director of psychology training at Montefiore Medical Center/Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York. &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re experiencing some of those symptoms at a level that is uncomfortable or that people are commenting on, it may be a good idea to seek support from a friend or loved one, or, if necessary, professional help.&rdquo; Talking to a pro, Rego notes, yields the long-term benefit of developing skills that will help you manage life better for years to come.</p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #6: Developing a Seamless addiction</strong></h3>

<p><span>The idea that takeout food is cheaper than healthier home-cooked meals </span><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/opinion/sunday/is-junk-food-really-cheaper.html?_r=0">is a myth</a><span>, plain and simple. So is the idea that preparing your own meals is a time suck. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t have to be a chef in order to cook,&rdquo; says Zeratsky. &ldquo;You can love to cook or you can hate to cook, you can have no time or you can have all the time in the world; you don&rsquo;t have to be a gourmet to put a healthy meal on the table. Think back to the basics of what comprises a nutritious meal: Do you have a fruit or a vegetable, a protein-rich food, something starchier that will provide you with good energy? It might not look like what you see on a cooking show or at a restaurant, but it&rsquo;s a complete meal.&rdquo; Almost </span><em>anything </em><span>you prepare for yourself, experts argue, will provide better nourishment than hyperprocessed fast food ever could.</span></p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #7: Happy hour wings and beer five&nbsp;nights a week</strong></h3>

<p>You&#39;re going to be spending 40 hours a week with your new coworkers&mdash;probably more time than you spend with your friends and family. So it&#39;s important to forge friendships in the office, and a common way to do it is hitting the bar after work.&nbsp;In one survey, 82% of respondents who headed to happy hour said they did so to <a href="http://www.careerbuilder.com/share/aboutus/pressreleasesdetail.aspx?id=pr439&amp;sd=6%2F24%2F2008&amp;ed=12%2F31%2F2008">bond with their coworkers</a>. But those bargain drinks and buckets of wings add up fast. A beer rings in at around 145 calories, and those savory little snacks are 50 to 100 calories apiece, even when you haven&rsquo;t dipped them in anything. Keep an eye out for <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20365592,00.html">lower-calorie options</a>, and don&rsquo;t be shy about bowing out before someone suggests karaoke.</p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #8: Forgetting what you learned in sex ed</strong></h3>

<p>According to the CDC, reported cases of three STDs (syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea) are <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/nchhstp/newsroom/2015/std-surveillance-report-press-release.html">on the rise</a> in the United States&nbsp;for the first time in a decade&mdash;and STDs continue to affect young people, particularly young women, most severely. Some health department officials believe <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/blame-tinder-rhode-island-social-media-stds-sexually-transmitted-diseases/">online-dating apps like Tinder are to blame</a>, and they could have a point; while moving to a city and turning to your phone to meet a friendly stranger <em>can </em>be good, clean fun, with sexual freedom comes responsibility. Playing it safe means testing and treatment for STDs (the CDC recommends that sexually active women under 25 be screened for chlamydia and gonorrhea, which often have no symptoms and go undetected, every year) and using condoms consistently and correctly.</p>

<h3><strong>Mistake #9: Losing contact with friends and family</strong></h3>

<p>In college, your friends lived down the hallway from you. Now, you&#39;re lucky if you live in the same city, or even the same state. But&nbsp;even if you don&rsquo;t have a whirlwind wedding engagement or splashy new job title to report, keeping up with old pals after graduation is worth the time and energy. &ldquo;People are social beings and therefore we derive a lot of benefits from staying in contact with others,&rdquo; says Rego. &ldquo;This includes emotional support and comfort and a sense of belonging. These benefits help create a buffer against daily and life stressors that come our way.&rdquo;</p>

        <![CDATA[These are a few of the best&nbsp;tips I picked up while writing her biography.
]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>As the editor-in-chief&nbsp;of <em>Cosmopolitan</em> magazine from 1965 to 1997, Helen Gurley Brown was famous&mdash;and famously criticized by feminists&mdash;for doling out endless advice on how to lose weight and how to catch a man. And while she often deserved the flak, she also dispensed gems of wisdom on countless other subjects, from balancing a budget to becoming an individual, at a time when most women&rsquo;s magazines taught housewives how to whip up the perfect pot roast and wax the floors before their husbands got home. Here are some of the best life lessons, both big and small, I discovered while writing a new biography of HGB, <em>Enter Helen: The Invention of Helen Gurley Brown and the Rise of the Modern Single Woman </em>($29; <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Enter-Helen-Invention-Gurley-Modern/dp/0062342665">amazon.com</a>).</p>

<h3>Take your pleasure seriously</h3>

<p>&ldquo;What is a sexy woman? Very simple. She is a woman who enjoys sex,&rdquo; Helen wrote in her 1962 bestseller,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Single-Girl-Before-Classics/dp/1569802521/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293216&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=Sex+and+the+Single+Girl"><em>Sex and the Single Girl</em></a>. It was a shocking message at the time (nice girls weren&rsquo;t supposed to have sex before marriage, let alone&nbsp;<em>enjoy</em>&nbsp;it), and it&rsquo;s one that she continued to deliver for the rest of her career: The more pleasure you get, the more pleasure you give.</p>

<h3>Work hard and pay your dues</h3>

<p>As a young woman, Helen worked 17 secretarial jobs before she became a high-powered and high-paid ad copywriter &agrave; la Peggy Olson. In&nbsp;<em>Sex and the Single Girl</em>, she shared what she learned along the way.&nbsp;Rule Number 1: &ldquo;DON&rsquo;T DEMAND INSTANT GLAMOUR.&rdquo; &ldquo;Give yourself time to get useful before you get difficult,&rdquo; she advised.</p>

<h3>Pack your lunch</h3>

<p>I know it&rsquo;s not the sexiest advice, but it is sound. When I worked at a magazine in Manhattan, I easily dropped $20 on an average meal, spending up to $100 a week! In <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Office-Classics-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/1569802750/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293430&amp;sr=1-2"><em>Sex and the Office</em></a>, Helen provides two Brown Paper Bag Plans designed to fill up the working girl without draining her wallet. &ldquo;Home-lunch can be delicious glamor-girl fodder instead of junk,&rdquo; she wrote, adding that you can even &ldquo;save enough money to spend Christmas in Jamaica.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Listen to people</h3>

<p>&ldquo;Never fail to know that if you are doing all the talking, you are boring somebody,&rdquo; Helen wrote in her 1982 book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Having-All-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/0283989866/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293476&amp;sr=1-2&amp;keywords=having+it+all+helen"><em>Having It All</em></a>. A conversation should be two-sided. Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to listen and learn.</p>

<h3>Sit up straight</h3>

<p>Helen gave a lot of nutty beauty advice over the years (she advocated wigs, plastic surgery, and lots of makeup), but this tip is timeless: &ldquo;Sit up straight, stand up straight, posture, posture, <em>posture</em>!&rdquo; she wrote in her 2000 book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Wild-Again-Helen-Gurley-Brown/dp/0446610003/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1462293536&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=i%27m+wild+again+helen"><em>I&rsquo;m Wild Again</em></a>. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20446224,00.html">Good posture</a> can make more difference in how you look than virtually anything else&rdquo;&mdash;and the best part is, it&rsquo;s free.</p>

<h3>Let your problems be your fuel</h3>

<p>A self-described &ldquo;mouseburger&rdquo; from Arkansas, Helen told and retold the tale of her childhood: Her father died young, her mother sunk into depression, her sister contracted polio, and the family fell on hard times. But those hard times also fueled Helen&rsquo;s need to succeed. &ldquo;Early-in-life problems can be the yeast that makes you rise into <em>bread</em>!&rdquo; she once wrote. In other words, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. Take it from HGB&mdash;or <a href="http://www.health.com/relationships/beyonce-lemonade-cheating">Beyonc&eacute;</a>.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>It is pitch black, and eerily quiet. I am floating in a foot of salt water, inside a light-proof, sound-proof tank. The air and the water are about the same temperature as my skin, and I realize I&rsquo;m not sure where my body ends and my surroundings begin. I suddenly feel dizzy, and a wave of nausea washes over me.</p>

<p>Two minutes down, 58 to go.</p>

<p>I am here, belly up in this pod, to see what floatation therapy is all about. In the last five years or so, the practice has grown wildly in popularity, with float centers springing up&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://floatationlocations.com/map/" href="http://floatationlocations.com/map/">across the country</a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Devotees claim floating transports the mind and body, offering profound relaxation, and a variety of other benefits, from pain reduction to&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/21/6-ways-to-be-a-creative-genius/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/10/21/6-ways-to-be-a-creative-genius/">enhanced creativity</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20977819,00.html" href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20977819,00.html">better sleep</a>.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED:</strong>&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20307153,00.html" href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20307153,00.html">Yoga Moves to Beat Insomnia, Ease Stress, and Relieve Pain</a></p>

<p>A few more minutes into my session, I start to get why people do this: As I focus on my breath&mdash;in and out&mdash;my tension melts away. I close my eyes and imagine myself drifting on a cloud.</p>

<p>When I hear the signal that the session is over, I can&rsquo;t believe an hour has passed. I know I didn&rsquo;t nod off. But my brain had somehow slipped out of its regular rhythm into an altogether different state where I lost track of time.</p>

<p>As I climb out of the pod, I feel a deep sense of calm, and incredibly refreshed&mdash;like I just woke up from the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/12/01/how-to-have-great-nap/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/12/01/how-to-have-great-nap/">best nap</a>&nbsp;of my life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The majority of people that achieve that restful state, they report the same type of effect,&rdquo; says physical therapist Robert Schreyer when I tell him about my float. He is co-owner of the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.nyaspire.com/floatation.html" href="http://www.nyaspire.com/floatation.html">Aspire Center for Health and Wellness</a>&nbsp;in New York City, which allowed me to float for free as a journalist in one of their two pods. (The usual price is $90.)</p>

<p>Schreyer and his staff often recommend that their physical therapy patients float before an appointment. &ldquo;When they get out, their muscles are more relaxed, and our interventions can be much more effective,&rdquo; he explains. That benefit may have something to do with the 1,000 pounds of Epsom salts&mdash;or magnesium sulfate&mdash;dissolved in the bath to make the water denser, and thus floaters more buoyant. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of theories that magnesium provides muscle relaxation,&rdquo; he says.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20800897,00.html" href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20800897,00.html">15 Natural Back Pain Remedies</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;But floating seems to be beneficial for everyone,&quot; he adds. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the ultimate way to detach.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Out in Tulsa, Oklahoma, clinical neuropsychologist Justin Feinstein, PhD, is trying to understand that&nbsp;mental piece&nbsp;of the float phenomenon. Feinstein is the director of the only float lab in the U.S.&mdash;the&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.laureateinstitute.org/justin-feinstein.html" href="http://www.laureateinstitute.org/justin-feinstein.html">Float Clinic and Research Center</a>&nbsp;at the Laureate Institute for Brain Research.&nbsp;His team has been using wireless, waterproof sensors and fMRI scans to collect data on what happens in the brain while people float.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our preliminary analyses are showing that the stress circuits of the brain are shutting off post-float,&rdquo; Feinstein tells me over the phone. Once he finishes this current study, he plans to explore the therapeutic potential of floating for people who suffer from anxiety, especially PTSD.&nbsp;(To avoid triggering claustrophobia in subjects, the lab has&nbsp;a specially designed open tank in a light-proof, sound-proof room.)</p>

<p>&ldquo;So what is it about floating that makes it so restorative?&rdquo; I ask him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s most likely a combination of a lot of variables,&rdquo; he explains. For one, you&rsquo;re in a near-zero gravity state, he says, which gives your body a chance to relax. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re also reducing external sensory input to the brain&mdash;reduced light, reduced sound, reduced proprioception, or how you feel your body in space.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This is why people refer to floating as a form of sensory deprivation. But Feinstein says that&rsquo;s actually a misnomer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What we&rsquo;re finding in our research is that floating is a form of sensory enhancement,&rdquo; he says, because it allows you to tune into your own body&mdash;especially your heartbeat and your breathing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It becomes an ideal environment for mindful meditation,&rdquo; Feinstein points out. &ldquo;For anyone who may have trouble&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/08/13/a-simple-guided-breathing-meditation/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/08/13/a-simple-guided-breathing-meditation/">focusing on their breath</a>&nbsp;outside of the tank, floating makes it lot easier to enter into a meditative state.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;</strong><a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2015/10/08/this-easy-meditation-method-will-help-calm-your-anxiety/" href="http://news.health.com/2015/10/08/this-easy-meditation-method-will-help-calm-your-anxiety/">This Easy meditation Method Will Help Clam Your Anxiety</a></p>

<p>What he says explains so much about my experience: I must have reached a meditative state during my float without even trying. I have never been able to meditate before. It had always seemed impossible to quiet the incessant chatter in my head. But inside the pod, it seemed to happen automatically.</p>

<p>Feinstein believes floating can help many other people like me&mdash;which could be a powerful thing, considering the proven&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20793239,00.html" href="http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20793239,00.html">health benefits of meditation</a>.</p>

<p>As for me, my float has inspired me to try again to&nbsp;<a data-mce-href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/18/5-meditation-tips-for-people-who-cant-focus/" href="http://news.health.com/2014/11/18/5-meditation-tips-for-people-who-cant-focus/">meditate the traditional way</a>. Now that I know what&rsquo;s possible, I&rsquo;m determined to learn. If I could start every day with that same calm and centered feeling of zen that I had when I climbed out of the tank, it would be life-changing.</p>

        <![CDATA[<p>In a recent Lenny Letter, actress Amanda Peet explained that she plans&nbsp;to stay <a href="http://www.lennyletter.com/culture/a352/never-crossing-the-botox-rubicon/">Botox-free</a>&nbsp;because she wants to&nbsp;set an example for her two young daughters, who are &quot;growing up <span class="s1">smack in the heart of America&#39;s youth-obsessed beauty culture.&quot; </span></p>

<p><span class="s1">But, she confessed, she&#39;s also scared:</span>&nbsp;&quot;<span>I&#39;m afraid one visit to a cosmetic dermatologist would be my gateway drug.&nbsp;</span><span class="s1">I&#39;d go in for a tiny, circumscribed lift and come out looking like a blowfish.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span>Whether you&#39;re philosophilcally&nbsp;against injectables&nbsp;or you&nbsp;wholeheartedly embrace&nbsp;them, everyone seems to have an opinion.&nbsp;Here, eight Hollywood stars</span><span>&nbsp;open up about aging naturally, or not.</span></p>

<p><span>&quot;I&#39;ve bleached my teeth, dyed my hair, peeled and lasered my face, and tried a slew of age-defying creams. More than once, I&#39;ve asked the director of photography on a show to soften my laugh lines. Nothing about this suggests I&#39;m aging gracefully.&nbsp;</span><span>Yet for me, it would be crossing the Rubicon to add Botox and fillers into the mix.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span>&mdash;Amanda Peet, <a href="http://www.lennyletter.com/culture/a352/never-crossing-the-botox-rubicon/">Lenny Letter</a>, April 2016</span></p>

<p><span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not advocating for it one way or another, I&rsquo;m just saying Botox changed my life.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&mdash;Kelly Ripa,&nbsp;<a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/kelly-ripa-declares-botox-changed-life/story?id=24599907"><em>&ldquo;Watch What Happens Live&rdquo;</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>July 2012</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;There is also this pressure in Hollywood to be ageless. I think what I have been witness to, is seeing women trying to stay ageless with what they are doing to themselves. I am grateful to learn from their mistakes, because I am not injecting s**t into my face.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">&mdash;</span>Jennifer Aniston,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.yahoo.com/beauty/jennifer-aniston-opens-up-on-aging-style-perfect-94103877638.html"><em>Yahoo! Beauty</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>December 2014</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;If it makes you happier and more confident, then why not? But I also think you have to do your research, so you know what to expect&mdash;that you&#39;ll look fresher but not necessarily younger. I don&#39;t want to age, but hey, what can you do? It&#39;s a natural process. I&#39;m trying to do it gracefully&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span class="s1">&mdash;</span>Sofia Vergara,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.instyle.com/news/5-beauty-products-sofia-vergara-cant-live-without"><em>InStyle Magazine</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>October 2014</p>

<p>&ldquo;My goal is to never get Botox. Or any other filler or injectable, for that matter&hellip;I don&rsquo;t hate on people who get Botox; I would just prefer to do everything&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/03/16/this-is-how-kristin-cavallari-plans-to-avoid-botox/">a more natural way</a>. We don&rsquo;t know the long-term effects of that stuff, and it doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me. We are supposed to age&mdash;that&rsquo;s part of life!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&mdash;Kristin Cavallari,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/balancing-in-heels-kristin-cavallari/1121817787#productInfoTabs"><em>Balancing In Heels</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>($25;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Balancing-Heels-Journey-Health-Happiness/dp/1623366380">amazon.com</a>),&nbsp;March 2016</p>

<p><span>&quot;Sometimes I use Botox. One time I did too much, though. I feel weird if I can&rsquo;t move my face, and that one time I overdid it, I felt trapped in my own skin. I don&rsquo;t have a problem with any of that stuff; if it makes you feel better about yourself and it&rsquo;s done properly, then fine.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span>&mdash;</span>Courteney Cox, <a href="http://www.instyle.com/news/our-august-cover-girl-courteney-cox"><em>InStyle Magazine</em></a><em>, </em>July 2010</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;Everyone always thinks I&#39;ve had my nose done or my lips done or just anything to my face like besides Botox, which to me isn&#39;t plastic surgery.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>&mdash;Kim Kardashian,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/news/a8156/the-look-kim-kardashian-071112/"><em>Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar&rsquo;s The Look</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em>July 2012</p>

<p><span>&ldquo;LA scares the crap out of me. I feel if I have to work out four hours a day, and count the calories of everything I put in my mouth, and have Botox at 22, and obsess about how I look the whole time, I will go mad, I will absolutely lose it.&rdquo;</span></p>

        <![CDATA[Three expert tips for managing your anger like a pro.
]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>Kelly Ripa fans (<a href="http://news.health.com/2015/11/27/kelly-ripa-favorite-workouts/">including us</a>) were eagerly awaiting her return to&nbsp;<em>Live! With Kelly and Michael</em>&nbsp;this week, to hear what she would say. Ripa was returning from a short&nbsp;hiatus following Michael Strahan&rsquo;s announcement last week that he was leaving the show to become a co-anchor on&nbsp;<em>Good Morning America</em>. (Ripa was reportedly <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/21/business/media/kelly-ripas-absence-from-live-points-up-rancor-at-abc.html?_r=0">blindsided</a>&nbsp;when she learned about his departure minutes before the announcement on April 19.)</p>

<p><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;I needed a couple of days to gather my thoughts,&rdquo;&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20981907_21002497,00.html">Ripa told the&nbsp;<em>Live!&nbsp;</em>audience</a><span>&nbsp;on Tuesday. &ldquo;After 26 years with this company I earned the right &hellip; I always speak from the heart so I didn&rsquo;t want to come out here and say something I regret.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span>We were impressed to say the least. Ripa handled the drama like a pro, and also noted that the events at ABC started a conversation &ldquo;about communication, consideration, and most importantly, respect in the workplace&rdquo;&mdash;which may be why her experience is resonating with so many people.</span></p>

<p><span>Who can&rsquo;t relate to feeling hot under the collar at work? &ldquo;Colleagues don&rsquo;t always act the way you want them to act, and situations don&rsquo;t roll out the way you want them to,&rdquo; says Alexandra Levit, a workplace consultant and co-chair of DeVry University&rsquo;s Career Advisory Board. But it&rsquo;s important to keep your cool to protect your reputation, she says. Here, a few anger coping tips from Levit and other experts to help you channel your rage in a productive way.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="http://www.health.com/mind-body/anger-management-tips">This Is the Best Way to Handle Your Anger</a></span></p>

<h3>Take a breather</h3>

<p><span>Ripa took a few days off to gain perspective. But even a few minutes can help when you&rsquo;re about to boil over. Say, &ldquo;I need to run to the restroom and I&rsquo;ll catch up with you in a couple of minutes.&rdquo; Even if you&rsquo;re in a meeting.&nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s better to get out and look weird, than be somewhere you can&rsquo;t control yourself,&rdquo; Levit says.</span></p>

<p><span>Losing control is a risk you can&rsquo;t afford to take, as Brad Bushman, PhD, a professor of communication and psychology at The Ohio State University, explained to&nbsp;</span><em>Health</em><span>&nbsp;in an earlier interview. &quot;Angry people are highly aroused and when people get aroused, they do and&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20581256_2,00.html">say things they later regret</a><span>.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span>After you&rsquo;ve left the scene, call a trusted friend to vent, suggests Levit. Or simply count: Counting&mdash;slowly&mdash;to whatever number seems appropriate gives your blood pressure and heart rate a chance to return to normal. The way Bushman put it: &quot;As time passes, arousal diminishes.&quot;</span></p>

<p><span>Then, head back in. &ldquo;The situation might be the same, but you got the emotion out of it, reducing the likelihood that the scenario will escalate,&rdquo; says Levit. Because flipping your lid is never a good idea. &ldquo;Even if you&rsquo;re in the right, no one will remember that. All they&rsquo;ll remember is that you screamed,&rdquo; she says.</span></p>

<h3>Know your triggers</h3>

<p><span>Gretchen Rubin, best-selling author of&nbsp;</span><em>The Happiness Project,&nbsp;</em><span>recommends doing some self-reflection to assess what fuels your fury. In a prior interview, she suggested, &ldquo;Is it because work seems meaningless? Because you can never get all your tasks done? Or because you have a&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.health.com/mind-body/anger-management-tips">conflict with a co-worker?</a><span>&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span>When you can anticipate your anger, you can practice coping in advance, says Levit. For example, you might imagine your boss criticizing you in a meeting. In front of a mirror, practice exactly how you&rsquo;d respond while remaining calm.</span></p>

<p><span>Tune into what triggers you to feel stressed, too. &ldquo;Stress can lead to anger, which can make you lose control,&rdquo; Levit points out. So if you know that tight deadlines freak you out, for example, try to work ahead so you&rsquo;re not racing against the clock.</span></p>

<p><strong>​RELATED: </strong><a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20765943,00.html">Best and Worst Ways to Cope with Stress</a></p>

<h3>Look for the positive</h3>

<p><span>When your expectations haven&rsquo;t been met, try to spin the scenario so it&rsquo;s less painful. Instead of thinking so-and-so&nbsp;</span><em>should&nbsp;</em><span>have done this or that, rephrase your thought train, Levit suggests. Start by stating how you have liked things to go down, and then name something you appreciate about your job:</span></p>

<p><em>I would have liked if my colleague did such-and-such. But since she didn&rsquo;t, I have to remember I [have a great job/get paid well/love what I do/make a difference]. So I&rsquo;m going to figure out how to get past this.</em></p>

<p>Team members who can &ldquo;make lemonade out of lemons&rdquo; are usually well-liked and valued in the workplace, she adds. &ldquo;People who can come back from adverse situations have better reputations.&rdquo;</p>

      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>You may have heard the news that&nbsp;Harvard University is struggling to contain an outbreak of mumps.&nbsp;<span>The school first confirmed two&nbsp;cases back in February, when director of health services Paul Barreira sent a letter to the community&nbsp;</span><a data-mce-href="http://links.mkt3495.com/servlet/MailView?ms=MTI3MjE4OTkS1&amp;r=Mjg4Njk3MDMyNDUS1&amp;j=NzAzMDA3MjU2S0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0" href="http://links.mkt3495.com/servlet/MailView?ms=MTI3MjE4OTkS1&amp;r=Mjg4Njk3MDMyNDUS1&amp;j=NzAzMDA3MjU2S0&amp;mt=1&amp;rt=0" target="_blank">stressing the importance of good hygiene</a><span>&nbsp;to prevent the illness from spreading. But&nbsp;now there are 40 cases on the Cambridge, Massachusetts,&nbsp;campus, with 11 students currently recovering in isolation, and&nbsp;</span><span>Barreira is increasingly concerned: &quot;I&rsquo;m desperate, I&rsquo;m desperate to get students to take seriously that they shouldn&rsquo;t be infecting one another,&quot; he told </span>student newspaper<em>&nbsp;The Harvard Crimson</em><span>. &quot;Students are not acting in a responsible way, knowingly <a href="http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2016/4/26/mumps-concerns-HUHS-director/">exposing other students to the virus</a>.&quot;</span></p>

<div>The classic <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/mumps/about/signs-symptoms.html">signs of&nbsp;mumps</a>&nbsp;are&nbsp;puffy cheeks and a swollen jaw,&nbsp;symptoms triggered&nbsp;by tender&nbsp;salivary glands. In children, the illness is generally mild&mdash;but in adults, it can lead to severe&nbsp;complications. And w<span>hile many people <em>are</em> vaccinated against mumps (including all incoming freshmen at Harvard), they can still get sick. Here, five things you should know about the disease.</span>

<p><strong>RELATED</strong>: <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20725771,00.html" target="_blank">How to Fight 14 Kinds of Classroom Germs</a></p>

<h3>The vaccine doesn&#39;t work for everyone</h3>

<p>In the U.S., most patients who get the MMRV vaccine&nbsp;(against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella)&nbsp;are innoculated with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Jeryl Lynn&nbsp;strain of the mumps virus, says <span>Aileen Marty, MD, a professor of infectious diseases at Florida International University.</span>&nbsp;(It&#39;s named after Jeryl Hilleman, the daughter of the doctor who developed the mumps vaccine.)&nbsp;Studies show that this&nbsp;strain offers protection for 95% of people&nbsp;<em>at best,&nbsp;</em>leaving about 5% of people vulnerable.&nbsp;&quot;That&#39;s why we give two doses,&quot; she says. &quot;The first dose at 12 to 15 months, and again at 4 to 6 years of age.&quot; But even with the standard two doses, some patients &quot;may not produce the quality or&nbsp;quantity of antibodies needed for life-long protection,&quot; she explains.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>You may not know you have mumps</h3>

<p>People typically experience non-specific symptoms at first, like muscle pain, headache, and a low-grade fever, says Dr. Marty. &quot;Then, in about a day or two, they&#39;ll start to notice the swelling of the parotid glands&mdash;glands in the cheek,&quot; she says. &quot;Usually both [cheeks]&nbsp;are affected, although one side usually swells up bigger than the other.&quot; Patients may also experience pain, difficulty swallowing,&nbsp;loss of appetite, and&nbsp;a general sense of being unwell.&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>But about 30% of patients don&#39;t develop any symptoms at all, which is part of the reason the virus&nbsp;can spread so quickly, as those people unwittingly infect others.&nbsp;&quot;Think of them&nbsp;as &#39;Typhoid Mary&#39; for the mumps virus,&quot; says Dr. Marty.</span></p>

<h3>It&#39;s highly contagious</h3>

<p>Another reason mumps is tough to avoid:&nbsp;&quot;Infected people shed the virus long before they start to have symptoms,&quot; says Dr. Marty.&nbsp;In other words, if your BFF contracts mumps, she may not realize she&#39;s&nbsp;ill&nbsp;until two days&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;she became&nbsp;contagious.&nbsp;&quot;So you don&#39;t really know who to protect yourself from.&quot; The virus is spread through saliva, so you could contract it from a cough, sneeze, or just talking to an infected person. To protect yourself, it&#39;s best to avoid&nbsp;sharing items such as cups or utensils, and to&nbsp;wash your hands frequently&nbsp;(and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20411346,00.html" target="_blank">for a full 20 seconds</a>).</p>

<h3>Mumps can become quite serious</h3>

<p>While most people recover from mumps within a few weeks, it&#39;s possible for the disease to worsen. Complications can include hearing loss, testicular inflammation (orchitis), inflammation of the ovaries (oophoritis)&mdash;even&nbsp;inflammation of the brain and spinal cord.&nbsp;&quot;This virus loves brain tissue,&quot; says Dr. Marty. &quot;As many as 50% to 60% of infected people experience a high rise in white blood cells in their&nbsp;cerebrospinal fluid, which can sometimes lead to someone manifesting symptoms of meningitis.&quot; In rare cases, patients could also suffer&nbsp;seizures or paralysis.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span>If you think you have it, see your doc immediately</span></h3>

<p><span>While there&#39;s no treatment for the disease itself, your primary care physician can treat your symptoms and monitor you for complications.&nbsp;</span><span>For example, Dr. Marty explains that your doctor may prescribe acetaminophen a&nbsp;nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug to reduce fever or</span><span>&nbsp;pain caused by swollen salivary glands. Warm or cold packs can also help relieve discomfort, she adds.&nbsp;</span><span>&quot;And i</span><span>f the patient develops meningitis or has persistent vomiting, we may provide IV fluids.&quot;</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It turns out <a href="https://www.shethinx.com/pages/index"><span class="s3">Thinx&nbsp;underwear</span></a> come in six styles, each with&nbsp;a&nbsp;level of absorbency measured&nbsp;in tampons (seriously): from hiphuggers (&quot;two tampons&#39; worth of fluid&quot;) to a <a href="http://news.health.com/2015/08/05/6-underwear-rules-every-woman-should-live-by/"><span class="s4">thong</span></a>&nbsp;(half a tampon&#39;s worth). But there is one key point that must be made clear: Thinx doesn&#39;t&nbsp;claim to <i>replace</i> your feminine hygiene product of choice. The company&#39;s site explains that their super-wicking undies&nbsp;are meant to serve as a backup, although depending on your flow, you may choose to rely solely on Thinx&mdash;which is what&nbsp;I bravely&nbsp;attempted to do for 48 hours.</span></p>

<h3>Day 1</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I&#39;m not gonna lie, even my pad-accustomed&nbsp;self was nervous about going solo with just these pretty panties for protection. Seeing how cute they were in person made me all the more dubious. How can this modestly thick fabric with lacy trim actually control bleeding?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">All morning long&nbsp;I found myself making paranoid&nbsp;trips&nbsp;to the bathroom. But&nbsp;all I could see was a relatively harmless-looking damp spot in my black cheeky undies.&nbsp;Once I felt confident that I wasn&rsquo;t going to spring a leak, I let myself have a normal Monday, which happens to be the day I take a kickboxing class&nbsp;at the gym. Exercising in&nbsp;the cheeky style was actually pretty cool. Every woman on team maxi knows the risk involved in&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2015/08/13/5-things-to-know-about-exercising-during-your-period/"><span class="s4">exercising on your period</span></a> (*cough* diaper rash). As someone who once ran&nbsp;14 miles with a pad on (go ahead, cry for me), this felt revolutionary.&nbsp;Immediately after my workout though, I couldn&#39;t wait to change into a fresh&nbsp;pair. (To clean my Thinx, I followed the instructions and hand-washed with soap and cold water, then hung them to dry.)</span></p>

<h3>Day 2</h3>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">For the heaviest day of my cycle,&nbsp;I whipped out the big guns&mdash;the hip huggers. These have about the same thickness as the cheeky cut, but&nbsp;a lot more booty coverage. By now, I was feeling confident that Thinx&nbsp;could handle my flow.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I put&nbsp;them on at around 8:00 am. But by 10:00 am,&nbsp;I felt like I was wearing a wet bathing suit. The underwear seemed to have stopped absorbing any moisture at all, as if they were filled to capacity, if that&#39;s even possible for underwear.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Like on day one, I was making&nbsp;regular trips to the bathroom, but this time I wasn&#39;t being overly cautious. Each time I blotted the fabric&nbsp;with gobs of toilet paper. Totally gross, I know. And then it got worse.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Around 3:00 pm, the unthinkable happened. I was typing away at my desk when I felt moisture between my thighs (cue middle school flashbacks). The undies had given up, well before I was ready to. &nbsp;To avoid the ultimate&nbsp;nightmare of visible&nbsp;leakage, I kept up my&nbsp;toilet paper blotting and by some&nbsp;miracle, it&nbsp;worked.</span></p>

<p class="p3"><span class="s5"><b>RELATED: </b><a href="http://news.health.com/2015/02/09/6-things-you-should-know-about-having-sex-during-your-period/"><span class="s4">6 Things You Should Know About Having Sex During Your Period</span></a></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Usually on Tuesdays I make a mad dash from work to the gym<b>,&nbsp;</b>to avoid&nbsp;the &quot;sorry I&#39;m late&quot; tiptoe&nbsp;into my favorite strength training class.<b>&nbsp;</b>I&rsquo;m a creature of habit so I wasn&rsquo;t about to let a pair of malfunctioning panties&nbsp;stand in the way of my routine.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But in retrospect I should have because it turned out wetness wasn&#39;t my biggest problem.&nbsp;Three pli&eacute; squats in&nbsp;and it occurred to me that my Thinx&nbsp;REEKED, which meant that <i>I</i> reeked. Pads must have been doing me a solid all these years,&nbsp;masking odor and sparing me the&nbsp;humiliation.&nbsp;I had no idea&nbsp;what unfiltered period stench actually&nbsp;smelled like.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In the end, yes, wearing Thinx underwear on a heavy day made me feel a lot like a 19th century woman on the rag. But I can definitely&nbsp;recommend sporting a pair&nbsp;on lighter days.&nbsp;Even after my&nbsp;personal hygiene nightmare, I didn&#39;t toss&nbsp;my hip huggers. After all, they were by no means ruined. They were <i>made</i> to survive leaks&mdash;which,&nbsp;all criticism aside, is pretty cool&nbsp;for a pair of period underwear.</span></p>

        <![CDATA[Turns out that quitters do win&mdash;and the payoffs are major. Here&#39;s how to just walk away... from a job, a relationship, a workout, or anything that&#39;s no longer doing it for you.&nbsp;
]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>Volunteering in a pediatric playroom at a cancer hospital is a pretty good thing to do, right? So I felt downright evil for wanting to quit. I was in my 20s; I had gotten a job with long hours, which meant I sometimes ended up stuck at work and had to bail on my 6 p.m. volunteer shift. Being unreliable wasn&rsquo;t fair to those kids, but I still couldn&rsquo;t bring myself to resign.</p>

<p>A lot of us delay quitting anything&mdash;jobs, activities,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20976691,00.html" target="_blank">relationships</a>, fitness routines, and even bland books&mdash;because we think we should have the grit to see it through, women warriors that we are. Extreme endurance is a virtue, if not an essential for succeeding in today&rsquo;s competitive work and Match.com market. Besides, most of us have been brought up to believe that winners never quit. We can do it! Even if it makes us miserable!</p>

<p>Quitting can be scary, but it&rsquo;s vital for overall satisfaction, not to mention joy. &quot;Life is too short to waste time and energy on things you find unrewarding or unproductive,&quot; says James E. Maddux, PhD, senior scholar at the Center for the Advancement of Well-Being at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va. &quot;Replace your source of dissatisfaction with something more fulfilling and you&rsquo;ll find more happiness.&quot;</p>

<p><strong>RELATED</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20986363,00.html" target="_blank">The Best Advice From the Healthiest People on the Planet</a></p>

<p>So what makes us stay the course when we&rsquo;re disgruntled or uninspired? It&rsquo;s human nature to adapt to circumstances, as frustrating,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20765943,00.html" target="_blank">stressful</a>, or just plain annoying as they may be. &quot;It&rsquo;s like having a bad knee&mdash;you learn to live with it, paying attention only when it really hurts,&quot; notes Maddux. Of course, you don&rsquo;t have to tough out that tempestuous neighborhood association or tepid&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20412059,00.html" target="_blank">hot yoga class</a>. Time is not infinite, and by ending something punitive, you make room for something pleasant.</p>

<p>There are even health payoffs to knowing when to throw in the towel. Research has shown that people who are better at bailing on unattainable goals have lower levels of cortisol (the stress hormone) and fewer&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/article/0,,20698919,00.html" target="_blank">headaches</a>&nbsp;than those who have a harder time. In one pivotal study, University of British Columbia psychologists tracked teenage girls for a year. The ones who more easily stopped pursuing hard-to-reach goals had declining levels of a protein that indicates bodily inflammation, linked to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/heart-disease" target="_blank">heart disease</a>.</p>

<p>These are the simple steps for giving the heave-ho to what&rsquo;s not working and getting to a better, happier place. It&rsquo;s mainly a mind shift&mdash;you focus as much on what you hope to gain as what you plan to lose from your life.</p>

<p><strong>RELATED</strong>:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20866947,00.html" target="_blank">12 Worst Habits for Your Mental Health</a></p>

<h3>1. Quit calling yourself a quitter</h3>

<p>The word quitter is associated with failure, notes Maddux, and feeling like a loser is dispiriting, so reframe your perspective. Try this financial analogy: &quot;Think, &#39;I am going to divest from this and reinvest my energy and efforts in something that will have a better payoff,&#39;&quot; he suggests. &quot;Once you stop seeing yourself as a quitter, it&rsquo;s easier to disengage.&quot;</p>

<h3>2. Get real about your misery</h3>

<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s hard to admit just how fed up or&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20497434,00.html" target="_blank">overwhelmed</a>&nbsp;you are, especially if you&rsquo;re the Little Engine That Could type. &quot;Stoicism is first cousins with masochism,&quot; says Alan Bernstein, a psychotherapist in private practice in New York City and coauthor of Quitting. Whether you&rsquo;re assessing how you feel about your job, your marathon training or a biography you&rsquo;re slooowly reading, it helps to consider if you have &quot;flow&quot;&mdash;when you get so absorbed in what you&rsquo;re doing that you lose a sense of time. It&rsquo;s one of the purest forms of contentment around, and if it&rsquo;s lacking, you&rsquo;re missing out.</p>

<h3>3. Ask yourself one little thing</h3>

<p>A question to ponder: Who, exactly, are you doing this for? That&rsquo;s the advice from Molly Mogren Katt, 33, of Minneapolis, who left her position as a communications director for a celebrity chef&mdash;which her friends considered the coolest job&mdash;to become a writer, one she finds to be the coolest. Now she regularly interviews accomplished quitters on her blog,&nbsp;<a href="http://heyeleanor.com/" target="_blank">Hey, Eleanor!</a>&nbsp;It&rsquo;s named after Eleanor Roosevelt, who famously said, &quot;Do one thing every day that scares you.&quot; &quot;People I speak with often say they were doing things they didn&rsquo;t love because they felt people or society expected them to,&quot; says Katt. &quot;One of my favorite stories is about a makeup artist who put in so much effort to look younger. Then she quit coloring her hair at 49&mdash;and landed a job as a model for Dolce &amp; Gabbana. Once she embraced who she was, she got a great gig.&quot;</p>

<h3>4. See the future</h3>

<p>The more you focus on&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/03/15/the-scientific-reason-you-arent-enjoying-your-free-time/" target="_blank">what you&rsquo;re going to do with that extra free time</a>, the easier quitting is. &quot;Writing down what you want next is motivating, empowering and invigorating,&quot; says Bernstein. So if you want&nbsp;<a href="http://news.health.com/2016/04/11/4-things-you-shouldnt-do-after-breakup/" target="_blank">out of a relationship</a>, say, mull over the essential qualities you&rsquo;re looking for in a future partner. True, it&rsquo;s not like you can order a boyfriend off Amazon (even via drone), but you&rsquo;ll feel more inspired to make it happen. As for times when there is no &quot;next,&quot; like when you just feel like ditching your role as PTA treasurer because you&rsquo;re overbooked, picture the benefits of life without it: Hello, more free time with your kids (not to mention your Hulu queue).</p>

<h3>5. Rehearse your exit</h3>

<p>Thinking ahead to what you&rsquo;ll tell a boss or your weekend tennis partner when you end things can quell paralyzing&nbsp;<a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20843057,00.html" target="_blank">anxiety</a>. &quot;Couch it in an empathic way: &#39;Although it may not be convenient for you&hellip;,&#39;&quot; advises Bernstein. &quot;The point is to connect to the other person&rsquo;s needs as well as yours.&quot; No matter how much you dread telling someone that you&rsquo;re bailing, the reality may surprise you. There&rsquo;s a chance that if you&rsquo;re feeling it, others are, too, as I discovered the day I finally told the coordinator I had to stop volunteering. She said she knew I was headed in that direction. And then she offered to let me volunteer on holidays, which I did for years to come. Proof that I&rsquo;m a quitter? Hardly&mdash;I&rsquo;d call that a win-win.</p>

<h3>Permission to quit, granted</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Watch only the good seasons of Orange Is the New Black/House of Cards/Luther.</li>
	<li>Unfriend people on Facebook who regularly post &quot;meh&quot; updates. Who cares if she&rsquo;s powerwashing her deck?</li>
	<li>Accept that you&rsquo;ll never do a triathlon. Not now. Not next year. Not ever.</li>
	<li>Give up making smoothies so healthy you have to hold your nose to drink them.</li>
	<li>Forget about getting the kids to make their beds. The neat police will not descend on your home.</li>
	<li>Quit forcing yourself to read the entire Sunday paper.</li>
	<li>Leave your hairdresser. She will survive.</li>
	<li>Abandon the hope of putting all your family photos into albums&mdash;iCloud for the win!</li>
</ul>

]]>
      </description>
      <content:encoded>
        <![CDATA[<p>We thought it was the flu. On a bleak afternoon this past winter, my 16-year-old daughter came home early from school, complaining of a fever and sore throat. Less than 48 hours later, I was sitting next to her in an ambulance, careening toward the nearest emergency room.</p>

<p><span>It wasn&#39;t the flu. An underlying urinary tract infection and a nascent case of strep throat had combined forces to create a perfect storm in my daughter&rsquo;s body, and she had gone into septic shock&mdash;the most severe stage of sepsis, a potentially fatal condition and a </span><a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/pages/factsheet_sePSIs.aspx">leading cause of all in-hospital deaths</a><span>.</span></p>

<h3>What is sepsis?</h3>

<p><span>Sepsis is an extreme bodily response to infection, in which inflammation throughout the body can lead to organ damage and even organ failure. It&rsquo;s often characterized by fever, a high heart rate, low blood pressure, confusion, and dizziness.</span></p>

<p><span>Sepsis doesn&#39;t have a particular season of the year, and it can hit almost anyone, regardless of age or prior health. In March, Oscar-winning actress </span><a href="http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20981907_20997149,00.html">Patty Duke died of sepsis</a><span> from a ruptured intestine at the age of 69. In 2009, 20 year-old Brazilian model </span><a href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/01/29/ep.sepsis.infection/index.html">Mariana Bridi da Costa</a><span> died within days after a UTI turned into an aggressive case of sepsis.</span></p>

<p><span>&quot;People with sepsis can slip from what seems like routine infection into a systemic situation very quickly,&rdquo; warns Anthony Fiore, MD, chief of Epidemiologic Research and Innovations in the Division of Healthcare Quality Promotion at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</span></p>

<p><strong>RELATED:</strong> <a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20479354,00.html">Should You Go to the ER?</a></p>

<h3>If it&rsquo;s such a big deal, why haven&rsquo;t I heard of it?</h3>

<p><span>Because there currently isn&#39;t a single standard methodology for assessing sepsis, hard statistics on its prevalence and mortality rates can be hard to pin down. But </span>according to the CDC<span>, over <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/basic/qa.html">one million cases of sepsis</a> occur each year, and it&rsquo;s the ninth leading cause of &ldquo;disease-related deaths.&quot; The National Institutes of Health reports that&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/education/pages/factsheet_sePSIs.aspx">sepsis kills more people</a><span> in the U.S. than prostate cancer, breast cancer, and AIDS combined.</span></p>

<p><span>Yet while less common conditions like </span><a href="http://news.health.com/tag/ebola/">Ebola</a><span> and </span><a href="http://news.health.com/tag/zika/">Zika</a><span> garner big headlines, you may not have ever even heard of sepsis before. Donald Landry, MD, chair of medicine at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, has a theory about that. &quot;It&#39;s a syndrome, not a disease,&quot; he says. &quot;It gets buried in other conditions. It doesn&#39;t register with the public as something identifiable.&quot;</span></p>

<h3>How can I recognize the symptoms?</h3>

<p><span>Fortunately, once you know the warning signs, sepsis can be recognized and effectively treated&mdash;and often with no further long term consequences.</span></p>

<p><span>&quot;If you get an infection, you&#39;re likely to have a fever and likely going to feel somewhat lousy,&rdquo; explains Craig M. Coopersmith, MD, a past president of the Society of Critical Care Medicine. &ldquo;But if you feel there&#39;s anything above and beyond that&mdash;if you feel your heart racing, if you&#39;re breathing fast, if your family recognizes that you&#39;re confused, if it feels like you&#39;re making less urine than usual&mdash;anything that feels abnormal to yourself or your loved ones might be a warning sign that not only might you have an infection, you might have an organ dysfunction. And if you do, that is a true medical emergency, </span>because your health and potentially the life of yourself or of your loved one<span>&nbsp;might be at stake.&quot;</span></p>

<p>If you suspect sepsis in yourself or a loved one (besides those listed above, other signs include pale or discolored skin, rash, and, as the CDC helpfully puts it, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/basic/qa.html">I feel like I might die</a>&rdquo;) the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/sepsis/basic/qa.html">CDC recommends</a> heading to the emergency room and saying directly, &ldquo;I am concerned about sepsis.&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="http://news.health.com/2016/03/03/8-things-er-doctors-refuse-to-have-in-their-homes/">8 Things ER Doctors Refuse to Have in Their Homes</a></p>

<p><span>My daughter&#39;s story has a happy ending. After a terrifying 36 hours in the ER and a potent mix of antibiotics, fluids, and dopamine, her condition stabilized. She spent a few days in the intensive care unit and another week recovering, then returned to school with no other ill effects than falling behind on her math homework.</span></p>

<p><span>That&#39;s the easily achieved outcome I now want for so many more families like mine. Simple awareness can make all the difference. As Dr. Coopersmith says, &quot;If sepsis is recognized in every patient and treated rapidly and appropriately, we can save multiple thousands of lives a year.&quot;</span></p>

        <![CDATA[<p>Nature has an ironic sense of humor: For a lot of women, the idea of having a baby is downright terrifying&nbsp;until one day, it suddenly isn&rsquo;t. But in many cases&nbsp;that day doesn&rsquo;t come until right around the time the baby-making window of opportunity is starting to close, and fast. &nbsp;</p>

<p><span>While our </span><a href="http://www.acog.org/Resources-And-Publications/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/Female-Age-Related-Fertility-Decline">fertility rates gradually decline</a><span> as we get older, there&rsquo;s a drop in our ability to reproduce between ages 32 and 37, with a more rapid fall after that, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).&nbsp;</span><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">That&nbsp;biological deadline is one of the reasons <a href="http://news.health.com/2016/04/21/how-to-sculpt-a-superhero-body-like-olivia-munn/">actress Olivia Munn</a>, 35&mdash;of </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">Iron Man 2</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"> and </span><em style="line-height: 1.6em;">Mortdecai</em><span style="line-height: 1.6em;"> fame&mdash;decided to freeze her eggs. Last week on the podcast</span><a href="http://celebritybabies.people.com/2016/04/13/olivia-munn-reveals-she-froze-her-eggs/" style="line-height: 1.6em;"> <em>Anna Faris Is Unqualified</em></a><span style="line-height: 1.6em;">, Munn talked about how much relief it has brought her: &ldquo;I think that every girl should do it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s also just like, why not do it.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span>In reality, the decision is a lot more complicated than that. Before you call your local fertility clinic, there are a few things you should know about the procedure technically known as oocyte cryopreservation.</span></p>

<p><span><strong>RELATED: </strong><a href="http://www.health.com/health/gallery/0,,20918587,00.html">15 Factors That Affect a Woman&#39;s Fertility</a></span></p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s not a one-step process&nbsp;</h3>

<p><span>The egg freezing procedure takes a few weeks, says Mindy Christianson, MD, an assistant professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Johns Hopkins University and a physician at the Johns Hopkins Fertility Center. First steps can include a baseline ultrasound and a blood test. After that, you&rsquo;ll start giving yourself injections of fertility hormones at home for about a week or so. The hormones will hopefully spur your ovaries to produce, say, 20 eggs, instead of just one. (Luckily, the needles aren&rsquo;t painful, says Dr. Christianson. They&rsquo;re similar to insulin pens.) Throughout the process, you&rsquo;ll need to return to your doctor&rsquo;s office for follow-up blood tests and ultrasounds.</span></p>

<h3>Egg retrieval is no day at the spa</h3>

<p><span>Your doctors will probably gather your eggs (sorry) with ultrasound guidance. They&rsquo;ll stick a long, thin needle into your vagina, then grab the eggs and prep them for freezing. You&rsquo;ll be under sedation for that, naturally. The good news: You&rsquo;ll probably only have mild cramping afterwards, and with a pain pill, you should be okay. (Though wait a few days to exercise, since your ovaries will be enlarged.)</span></p>

<h3>It&rsquo;s pretty expensive</h3>

<p><span>After tallying up the costs of the injections, doctor&rsquo;s visits, and the procedure itself, you&rsquo;re probably looking at a bill that can total $10,000 to $15,000, says Dr. Christianson. And then there&rsquo;s the cost of storing the eggs, which may set you back anywhere from $500 to $800 a year.</span></p>

<p><span>However, the&nbsp;price tag looks better after you turn 40. A 2012 study in the journal </span><em>Fertility and Sterility</em><span> found that a woman trying to get pregnant at age 40 would save $15,000 if she froze her eggs at age 35. That&rsquo;s because the costs of using assisted reproductive technology to get pregnant after you&rsquo;re 40 can be </span><a href="http://www.fertstert.org/article/S0015-0282(15)00159-4/abstract">more expensive than freezing your eggs</a><span> at a younger age.</span></p>

<h3>Egg freezing isn&rsquo;t endorsed as a way to delay having kids</h3>

<p><a href="http://www.acog.org/-/media/Committee-Opinions/Committee-on-Gynecologic-Practice/co584.pdf?dmc=1">ACOG</a><span>, the</span><a href="https://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Practice_Guidelines/Committee_Opinions/Ovarian_tissue_and_oocyte(1).pdf"> American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM), and the Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology</a><span> all agree: There&rsquo;s &ldquo;no data to support the safety, efficacy, ethics, emotional risks, and cost-effectiveness of [egg freezing for the purpose of circumventing reproductive aging].&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also worth pointing out that the technique used today is still relatively new.&nbsp;It was only in 2012 that the ASRM recommended that oocyte cryopreservation no longer be considered an </span><a href="https://www.asrm.org/uploadedFiles/ASRM_Content/News_and_Publications/Practice_Guidelines/Committee_Opinions/Ovarian_tissue_and_oocyte(1).pdf">&ldquo;experimental&rdquo; procedure</a><span>.</span></p>

<h3>You aren&rsquo;t guaranteed to get pregnant afterward</h3>

<p><span>A 2015 study published in the </span><em>Journal of the American Medical Association</em><span> found that using </span><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2425734&amp;resultClick=3">in-vitro fertilization with frozen eggs</a><span> resulted in a live birth about 43 percent of the time. But of course, </span>no one<span> is guaranteed to get pregnant. Even a healthy, fertile 30-year-old woman only has a </span><a href="http://jama.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2425734&amp;resultClick=3">20% chance of getting pregnant per cycle</a><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>If you are interested in exploring the possibility of freezing your eggs, you may want to start by looking up the clinics near you. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention keeps this database of fertility clinics in every state with </span><a href="http://nccd.cdc.gov/DRH_ART/Apps/FertilityClinicReport.aspx">statistics on their success rates</a>.</p>
